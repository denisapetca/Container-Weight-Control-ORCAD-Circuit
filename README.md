# Container-Weight-Control-ORCAD-Circuit
This project designs a weight control system for a container used to store stone pieces in construction. The stones, varying in size, are transported via a conveyor belt and deposited into the container. A weight sensor with a specified linear resistance variation measures the container’s weight. This resistance is converted into a voltage variation within the range [0 ÷ (VCC-2V)].

The system maintains the container’s weight within a specified range using a comparator and an electromagnetic relay that controls the conveyor belt. The belt-relay assembly is modeled using a resistor. A LED indicates the belt’s operational state (on/off).
